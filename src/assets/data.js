        comment:'Our gulet cruise from Kos to Patmos was everything and more than expected. It lived up to the Peter Sommer Travels emphasis on culture, history, archaeology, comfort and camaraderie. Exceptional guides attended to each guests interests and needs and were exceptional hosts. Very enjoyable were swimming in secluded bays, the wonderful food quality and selection and the sites visited on each island',
